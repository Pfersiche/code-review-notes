# code-review-notes

my initial suggestions would be things like are you calling all your functions, have you checked for typos and accidental capitals?
are all brackets, curly braces and square braces closed?
Are your html and javascript files linked?
Are your image assets linked in properly?
Double check IDs, classNames and, functions all match where they need to!
is your json properly populated?
#
I'm struggling to find what the problem here is myself, but maybe checking these could help (I feel like I've got more used to the structure of react now so it's hard to get out of that mindset of how that flows)
#
I'm not sure but perhaps clearCart is happening at some point when it shouldn't?
